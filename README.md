# Roguelike Text Adventure

## a fun little proof of concept of a procedurally generated text adventure running in the browser

Currently just an ascii window drawing project (and barely the skeleton of that, even)

### To build:

```
npm init
npm run build
```

### To build for dev (webpack watch with server on localhost:3000):

```
npm init
npm run dev
```

(dev mode may keep files in memory, so build directory might not appear)
